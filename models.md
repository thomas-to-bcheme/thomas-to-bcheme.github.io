### Algorithmic model:
Refactoring previous proprietary financial technology, the minimum viable product for this deliverable will be to feed in financial API data using [Coincap OpenAPI](https://pro.coincap.io/api-docs) to our database and displayed onto the frontend. This will be the basis dataset for fresh data being accumulated overtime upto the storage limitations of the database where "expired" data will be removed.
Depending on availabile captail, a comparison of [treasury data](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/api-documentation/) may also be done with respects to a mutual time freqeuency for analyzing trends and predicting the differences between the data sets in a real world fashion to understand the relationship of paper currency to crypto currency.

note: Algorithmic models & methods are inherently static by design.

### Agentic model:
As of Dec 2025, Gemini was selected as the LLM due to better support for free features (i.e number of tokens) compared to other providers. Due to the free limitiations, an agentic news letter will be designed as one-way, ran daily; or weekly, depeneding on previous KPI metrics.

More robust agentic models and methods (e.g RAG) are out of scope at this time of a minimally viable product to showcase agentic compentecy and capabilities not in a professional setting.
