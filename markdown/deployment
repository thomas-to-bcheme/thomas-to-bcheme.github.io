## Deployment Frequency & Risk Assessment

The chart below visualizes the deployment consumption against the platform's hard limit. The "Danger Zone" begins where automated usage consumes the safety buffer required for manual intervention.

## Risk Model

To quantify operational stability, we define the **Risk Factor ($R$)** as the percentage of the daily limit consumed by automation.

$$
\text{Let } T = \text{Interval in Minutes}
$$

$$
\text{Daily Usage } (U) = \frac{1440 \text{ min}}{T}
$$

$$
\text{Risk Factor } (R) = \left( \frac{U}{L_{max}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

### Risk Condition Logic
A system is considered "Unstable" if it consumes the 20% buffer reserved for manual hotfixes.

### Absolute Maximum Absolute Risk Frequency
Running a deployment every 15 minutes utilizes **96%** of the daily capacity immediately:

$$
\text{At } T=15\text{min}: \quad R = \left( \frac{96}{100} \right) \times 100\% = \mathbf{96\%} \quad (\text{CRITICAL})
$$

*Result: Only 4 slots remain for maintenance*

---

## Optimized to the Maximum Allowable Risk Frequency

To determine the fastest possible safe interval ($T_{safe}$) that utilizes 80% of the daily capacity:

$$
\text{Target Usage } (U_{safe}) = L_{max} \times 0.80 = 80 \text{ deployments}
$$

$$
T_{safe} = \frac{1440 \text{ min}}{U_{safe}}
$$

$$
T_{safe} = \frac{1440}{80} = \mathbf{18 \text{ minutes}}
$$

**Result:** An interval of **18 minutes** is the mathematical hard limit for safety.

### Comparison of Acceptable Realistic Frequencies: Hourly vs. 30 Minutes
The following table compares the capacity impact of standard cron schedules against the platform hard limit ($L_{max}=100$).

| Metric | Hourly (60 min) | 30 Minutes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daily Deploys ($U$)** | 24 | 48 |
| **Risk Factor ($R$)** | 24 | 48 |
| **Status** | ✅ **SAFE** | ⚠️ **CAUTION** |
| **Buffer Remaining** | 76 slots | 52 slots |

### Final Decision
30 Minutes during active development and maintenace of tools while under continous deployment and allow for continual uptime for users to interact with the production server upto 20 minutes when the project life cycle has reached it's deployed monitoring phase and is no longer undergoing development of new features given the (financial) constraints previously mentioned.

An additional layer of security for risk migitation can be used to omit deploying changes and develop in an local enviornment when working in the backend.
