### Database:

This project was initially scoped for the use of AWS database services; opting for dynamoDB, to support both structured and unstructured data types as a way to demonstrate use of AWS Cloud infrastructure. However, the free license expires after a year or when credits end. An alternative database solution from reviewing [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/storage#choosing-a-storage-product) was identified sufficient for data type, data size, latency, durability, and consistent performance in this proof of concept; designed for as "real-time" as possible, Edge Config.

The selected database and it's respective [limits and pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-config/edge-config-limits) has been conducted using [Edge Config API Endpoint](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-config/using-edge-config#querying-edge-config-endpoints) to ingest third party API data not otherwise manually scraped, transformed, and loaded into the github repository.

# Strategic Architecture Report: Persistence & Agentic Design

**Subject:** Architectural Pivot from AWS DynamoDB to Hybrid Vercel/GitHub Persistence  
**Role:** Technical Lead (Agentic Systems)  
**Status:** Implementation Ready

---

## 1. The AWS DynamoDB Longevity Constraint
While AWS DynamoDB was initially considered for its robust handling of structured and unstructured data, it was ultimately rejected during the **Longevity Audit**. 
* **The Constraint:** AWS Free Tier services typically expire after 12 months or upon credit depletion. 
* **The Decision:** To adhere to the project's **"Forever-Free"** mandate, the architecture moved away from AWS to eliminate the "financial kill-switch" inherent in trial-based cloud credits.

## 2. Inverted Database Best Practices (Vercel & GitHub)
Designing for Vercel requires navigating **Serverless Ephemerality** (data loss upon container shutdown) and strict **60-second execution timeouts**. This design enforces a professional, tiered persistence model to bypass these limits.

### A. The "GitHub Data Warehouse" (Layer 1)
Due to Vercel's execution constraints, **GitHub** serves as the primary backend and compute engine.
* **Role:** Houses raw, historical, and unstructured data (`/src/data/btc-history.json`).
* **Compute:** GitHub Actions perform the "Heavy Lifting" (web scraping, HMM training, and Agentic reasoning) that would otherwise time out on Vercel.

### B. Vercel Edge Config (Layer 2: Production Cache)
Following Vercel’s [storage best practices](https://vercel.com/docs/storage#choosing-a-storage-product), **Edge Config** was selected for its ultra-low latency and durability.
* **The Strategy:** Edge Config is not used for raw ingestion. It is reserved exclusively for the **"Highest Layer"** of production-ready data.
* **The Workflow:** Data is extracted and cleaned on GitHub; only the finalized insights and Agentic equations are pushed to the [Edge Config API Endpoint](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-config/using-edge-config#querying-edge-config-endpoints).

## 3. The Agentic Machine Learning Loop
The system moves beyond static code into **Unsupervised Autonomy** by bridging the data warehouse with agentic reasoning.

### I. Unsupervised Model: Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
The system categorizes Bitcoin price data into "Market Regimes" (e.g., Stable vs. Volatile), providing the essential context for the Agentic Brain.

### II. The Agentic Self-Correction Loop
Every 24 hours, the system executes an autonomous cycle:
1.  **Ingest:** Fetch latest data via CoinCap.
2.  **Evaluate:** Compare yesterday's prediction against actual price; calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE).
3.  **Reason:** An LLM Agent analyzes the HMM state transition and past accuracy logs.
4.  **Adapt:** The Agent generates a new **Symbolic Regression Equation** for the upcoming window.
